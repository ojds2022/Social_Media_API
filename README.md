## Installation
This program utilizes npm for package management. Dependencies include express and mongoose. Users can install all dependencies by running 'npm i' in the terminal.

## Usage
Users should start by running 'node seeds/index.js' in the terminal in order to seed the database. Next, users can run 'node server.js' in the terminal to start the server. Once started, routes can be tested using an API tester such as Insomnia.
